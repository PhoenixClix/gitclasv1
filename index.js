// How to Delete a Git Branch Both Locally and Remotely 

// Deleting a branch LOCALLY
// Delete a branch with git branch -d <branch> . The -d option will delete the branch only if it has already been pushed and merged with the remote branch. Use -D instead if you want to force the branch to be deleted, even if it hasn't been pushed or merged yet. The branch is now deleted locally.

// console.table({'git branch -d <branch>'})
